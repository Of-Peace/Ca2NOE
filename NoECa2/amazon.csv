 on 6 April 2014 // Part of the magic for me growing up as a boy was to buy (or be given) the new Hornby catalogue every year, even if it included 90% of the same products as the previous year.  I've still got my old ones dating back to the 70s and 80s somewhere.  These days the catalogue is especially informative in that it tells you the vintage of the rolling stock which is useful if you are dedicating your railway to one particular era and train company. | Amazing detail fabulous photography. // 5.0 // 11 April 2015 // By

(no joke, it literally did!)It's very easy to connect the plastic track/assemble, it takes 2 mins. It's very easy to connect the trains together and apply to track.All you need is two AA batteries and time to watch your child enjoy themselves!We even added homemade tunnels to this to make it more fun, we simply cut holes in cardboard boxes to put around certain parts of the track!This is brilliant for very young kids if they're very interested in trains.

Adults and kids collectively enjoy its appearance from around the Christmas tree.Whilst I use this as effectively a Christmas tree decoration it is nevertheless a quality Hornby OO gauge model in its own right, and could be used year round for a modelling enthusiast.A word of warning would be that the model is delicate and intricate.

 on 13 Nov. 2011 // My 2 year old loves chuggington so we decided to get her this set. To be fair i dont think there is much longevity with it and after a while my daughter played with the train itself rather than the train and track although it does still come out now and again. I had read some reviews that you have to keep building the track as it comes apart easily. I think that depends on if your child is heavy handed or not, i havent had to keep putting it back together but i could see that if a child was a bit heavy handed then you would be up and down all the time. I have taught my 2 year old to try and put it back together on her own and she can mangae to do some bits but does force them together if they are round the wrong way, but time will cure that. Overall yes im glad i got it for her and i dont regret buying it, there are better products out there or might be just worth getting them the trains on there own. | Excellent entertainment set // 5.0 // 11 Feb. 2014 // By

TOP 50 REVIEWER on 12 Mar. 2014 // This is an excellent HO scale diorama piece comprising of a white enclosed coach, with a pair of white horses, and two figures on the (red) driving seat dressed in a grey livery. One is a man in a grey greatcoat and top hat, the other is a female in a grey coat or uniform jacket and grey jockey-style of cap. There do not appear to be figures inside, but if you look through the back window, these are heads visible. This is a striking model, and would be an excellent decoration for almost any diorama.As you would expect from Preiser, these figures are of a high quality of manufacture, detail and colouring. Note that I originally paid £20 for my set, so it pays to shop around in your local model shops – or even a distant one.

 on 9 July 2011 // Got these for my 2 yr old - he's obsessed with trains and loves these characters. They are pretty tough so have survived some bashing. Only thing is that he can't get them to attach to each other with the ball/ socket joint, it's a bit fiddly so I have to help with that (repeatedly as they do come apart quite easily!) However, this won't be an issue as he gets older. Only got Brewster and Wilson this time to see how he got on, but think I will be getting the track and Koko for xmas as he plays with these for ages and loves talking to them (not sure he realises the trains talk to each other, he just thinks they talk to him... could be setting myself up for years of counselling with that :) | Fabulous toy // 5.0 // 2 Feb. 2014 // By

TOP 500 REVIEWERVINE VOICE on 16 Oct. 2014 // This is a pretty decent starter set as a first step into model railways.You get a very nice detailed model of the Gloucester City and its tender, and three equally well-detailed model coaches. The locomotive is DCC-ready. (DCC is the digital control system for model railways allowing different trains to run at different speeds o the same tracks - DCC-ready indicates that the loco has a socket into which a DCC module can be slotted in future; the controller provided with the set is not DCC-compatible.)As with all Hornby starter sets, there is sufficient track included for a simple oval circuit with a single siding and one set of points. Hornby points are a bit flimsy - they don't seem to click as positively into one side or the other as I remember those on the model railways of my youth doing, but the track is fine otherwise. The fishplates are reassuringly tight, and it all slots together easily. There is also a ""trackmat"" supplied, which is a rather grand name for a large printed sheet of glossy paper with a suggested layout, to make all of which requires you to buy rather a lot of extra track and accessories - more a piece of marketing than anything really useful.The supplied controller is a simple rheostat - you can turn the speed up and down and select forward or reverse, but it's all you need to get started. (If you get keen, you can buy a DCC module for the locomotive and a DCC controller to give more control options for a more sophisticated layout.)Putting it all together took 20 minutes or so - it's reasonably obvious how you assemble it all, which is fortunate as the supplied instructions are a bit sketchy. Not really a problem, as most bits will only fit one way!Read more › | The loco is nice and sturdy and has a good weight to it // 4.0 // 3 Dec. 2015 // By

 on 3 Dec. 2015 // A typical Hornby starter set. The loco is nice and sturdy and has a good weight to it, and for a ""railroad"" model the detail is very good! The Pullman coaches are equally attractive to look at, and feel as though they will last a good while. The track included, while a fairly minimal amount, is sufficient to get the set moving comfortably. The only downside in my opinion is the controller feels very cheap. I would not expect to see much use from it. However for the fact I am viewing this as simply a test model for something much larger, it will not see too much heavy use anyway. The loco runs smoothly and quietly, and I can't wait to see it running on a much larger layout! | Good starter for the enthusiast // 5.0 // 1 Dec. 2015 // By

TOP 1000 REVIEWERVINE VOICE on 14 Oct. 2014 // This is a lovely set to own and my only serious reservation is that you really need to spend quite a lot more on extras, to get the best out of it. As a starting point, it's great though.The track is good-quality but does need a flat, solid base. You'll need to spend time getting the creases out of the supplied 1600x1180mm ""MidiMat"" too.The detailing on the locomotive and carriages is pretty good. The conn rods move nicely and you can see inside the carriages, with their white `table cloths' and gold-coloured lamps. It could be better still but most people will be perfectly happy with it, as I am.The box suggests all sorts of further sets to enhance this one. The Basic Oval and Track Pack A (R8221) are included, to create an extended oval with a siding. Adding Track Packs B and C (R8222 and R8223) gives you a double oval with siding (but just one pair of points connecting them). D and E (R8224 and R8225) make it really interesting, but that's almost £100, so far, and you can still add F (R8226) for extra sidings. Oh, and you'll need a new 1800x1200 TrakMat, R8217, to go with packs E and F.Then you'll want to add accessories such as stations, signal boxes and engine sheds. The message is...don't imagine £150 for this set will be the end of your expenditure!Without at least the extra track, the set will be pretty dull unless you just want to go round and round in circles with the occasional foray into the siding. Hence 1 star deducted for 'fun'.Some parts, notably some of the couplings, seem rather fragile. I wouldn't recommend this set for younger children and would suggest 8 as an absolute minimum, and only with a lot of adult supervision. 10 or 12 would be better.Read more › | A good starter set. // 4.0 // 19 Jan. 2015 // By

 on 19 Jan. 2015 // This is the railroad version of the Duke of Gloucester which is slightly less detailed than the top of the range model and consequently less fragile. The three Pullman coaches are also from the Railroad range and do not have interior lighting as do the top of the range models. It is a pity that the roofs are silver and a bit ""flashy"", they would have been better in grey. Another slight inconvenience is that the couplings do not match. The loco has the newer style couplings and the coaches the wider older style but this does not impede hooking up however. This train set was a real bargain at the price I paid at the time.",

It was employed on long-distance express trains on the LNER and its successors, British Railways Eastern and North-Eastern Regions, notably on the 10am London to Edinburgh Flying Scotsman service after which it was named. In its career 4472 Flying Scotsman has covered more than 2,000,000 miles (3,200,000 km).Young or old, keen modeller or just a beginner, the Hornby RailRoad range answers the needs of many and is a perfect complement to the variety of locomotives, rolling stock, track, buildings, and accessories that can be found in the current Hornby catalogue. Devoid of easily damaged detail parts the suitably livered RailRoad locomotives are fitted with efficient drive mechanisms and have pickups on all drive wheels ensuring smooth running. All the RailRoad models are fitted with the standard Hornby hook and bar type couplings and will therefore easily couple to those locomotives and rolling stock in both the standard Hornby and Thomas & Friends ranges.

TOP 50 REVIEWER on 14 July 2014 // This is a finely-detailed HO-scale model of a Bavarian Sate Railways (Epoch 1) baggage/post wagon in the standard epoch 1 green livery, with a black roof. It is a bogie vehicle with end vestibule doors and two sliding doors each side, with a guard's compartment fitted with a `birdcage' roof at one end. Some internal detail can be seen through the windows and sliding doors (unfortunately, so can one of the screw-fittings for a bogie). The running number is PPu 17660, and there is a destination board for a Munchen to Berlin service.This model is fitted with the standard `loop' style of coupling. It is packaged in the current standard Trix card box with a transparent window with a transparent plasticky internal tray with side cover.This is a beautifully detailed model, as you would expect from Trix, and is of a high quality of manufacture. Note that there are other models available to form a rake of the Munch to Berlin coaches.","{""seller""=>{""Seller_name_1""=>""bw bahn"", ""Seller_price_1""=>""£36.51""}}"

Plastic model kit. Manufacturers Description: William Stanier (1876-1965) was headhunted from the GWR to become Chief Mechanical Engineer of London, Midland and Scottish (LMS) Railways in 1932. With the support of the Chairman, Sir Josiah Stamp, Stanier is credited with modernising the LMS fleet of generally small steam locomotives with a larger, modern and more powerful array of designs. Soon after his appointment, Stanier also focused on refurbishing and standardising the Coach stock of the LMS and developed the Period III LMS coaches which later became known as Stanier Coaches. These designs were extremely popular and successful and many were still in service in the mid 1960's. There are many examples of Period III coaches operating on Heritage Railways throughout the UK today. The Dapol OO Model of the Stanier Coach is derived from refurbished Airfix/Mainline tooling originally purchased by Dapol in the 1980's. There are some compromises on detail accuracy due to the condition and usability of the 40+ year old tooling. However, we feel the model captures the essence of the Period III coach design well and offers an extremely affordable way of building up a fleet of pre or post nationalised fleet of LMS coaches. Dapol have strived to ensure livery and colour details have been captured and are comparable to the originals, including the roof level gold lines.

 on 20 Nov. 2013 // I bought this Train set for my son and am a complete novice when it comes to Train sets.The Hornby set feels solid and attention is paid to the detail on the train. It comes with a mat, which is actually a giant printed poster. For the long term, a hard backing is needed.The track layout feels like it is the next size up from a basic layout as it already contains an extension pack.The train itself is not huge and looks silly pulling long  passenger carriages (as it would on a real train).It is quite expensive and had I not seen it at a reduced price, I probably would not have bought it (hence 4 / 5). The train can actually go quite fast in both directions. As novice I have discovered several features that must be well known to train set enthusiasts:The Trains can be tricky to get all wheels on the track. (I think there is an accessory to help with this)Big Long carriages do not like tight bends at speed (they come off).When using points to guide the train onto an inner circuit (I bought more track) you need to get jumper leads from Hornby and these are not included in Extension packs A & B.Without these the train loses power, but I think they are relatively cheap.The Track needs to be cleaned with a cloth, as any grease / dirt can stop the power to the trainTrain track has to be carefully aligned when joining one section to another, so continually putting it away and getting it out is time consuming - setting it up on a hard backing is a better solution.My child is very careful with the set and its contents, but not an ideal present for kids who leave it lying around and step on it (the carriages are expensive). I can see why people like train sets and this is a good introductory set with the plethora of accessories and trains etc from Hornby  and others we were left wanting to buy more bits and pieces (such as electric rather than manual points) after using this set. | Excellent introduction  to the hobby. // 5.0 // 26 Oct. 2014 // By

VINE VOICE on 26 Oct. 2014 // Every child should own a train set, and lately I've started suspecting that every middle-aged man should have one too, so I ordered this so that  me and my little lad will have a shared interest. (And,  if he turns out to be more interested in video games and hoverboards and whatnot, that's OK too: I shall move the layout to my shed and drink homebrew alone, whilst building titchy windmills).It's nice to see, after not handling  a set since the early 70s, that Hornby still maintains that quality old-school feel, lots of detailed modelling and reassuring metal components. This starter set represents a small pre-war Welsh local service, with both passenger and freight carriages, but comes with a printed landscape mat which shows you how you might extend this into a more ambitious layout.It's very difficult to find anything to criticise about this set: I guess everyone knows that Hornby are the Dons of the model railway game, and the price is what it is: They've always been quite expensive toys. One issue might be that most larger layouts now are apparently controlled digitally, whereas this is on an old style analogue controller, which I guess means that if you decide to build up to a set with more trains, etc, this  set would have to run on a separate track?So, I'm really glad i own a trainset again, and am looking forward to spending my dotage buying tiny little tins of humbrol enamel in shades like GWR Olive Drab and staring into the windows of model shops wondering whether to invest in the  1/72 00/H0 Village Garage with Petrol Pump. | Great starter set, but do your research // 4.0 // 3 Jan. 2015 // By

TOP 500 REVIEWER on 3 Jan. 2015 // My son was purchased this train set for Christmas. My son is mad on trains and loves model train sets set up in shops, museums etc. I have never used a Hornby set before, but it is clearly well thought out, very detailed and is high quality. The first time I put it together I was surprised how fiddly it was, it certainly is not for a child to put together. The track was huge, but there is not an awful lot of variety to the set, it can be oval or circular and that's about it. It comes with a large poster of the ground that is ideal for aesthetics, but in the long term its best to be on some sort of hard backing - and here is where the issue with this is. It is such a great toy, very classic, but to put it on a board is so much more complicated than it appeared for a few reasons. 1. It's huge, to put it on a board you need a dedicated space where it could be on a table or put away in some sort of bespoke contraption. We have allocated space under a double bed for the board. A chunk of MDF this size is around £15-£20. 2. My second idea when I realised how much floor space it takes up I thought it may be better to go up a mountain for example, but to go up you need to slope very very gradually, otherwise it climbs a bit and slides back down. I put one side sloping up using a how to train your dragon book on each side and two at the end and it couldn't climb up the far end. 3. Once you accept its going to take up a loafs of space, and once you accept it won't slope upwards much you will naturally look to add variety to the track. We looked at having the large oval with two half circles on the inside by adding 3 3rd radius double curves in two places in the middle (total of 6), as well as one more left hand curve and straight and two right hand curve and straight pieces.Read more ›","{""seller""=>[{""Seller_name_1""=>""KNC Toys"", ""Seller_price_1""=>""£65.00""}, {""Seller_name_2""=>""Amazon.co.uk"", ""Seller_price_2""=>""£69.99""}, {""Seller_name_3""=>""Gaugemaster"", ""Seller_price_3""=>""£79.95""}, {""Seller_name_4""=>""Gameseek"", ""Seller_price_4""=>""£80.48""}, {""Seller_name_5""=>""CLIFFORD JAMES"", ""Seller_price_5""=>""£79.99""}, {""Seller_name_6""=>""Frome Models Centre"", ""Seller_price_6""=>""£89.99""}, {""Seller_name_7""=>""TrainStop"", ""Seller_price_7""=>""£91.99""}, {""Seller_name_8""=>""Models & Computers Plus"", ""Seller_price_8""=>""£92.99""}, {""Seller_name_9""=>""GamesQuest"", ""Seller_price_9""=>""£104.99""}]}"

TOP 50 REVIEWER on 30 Jun. 2014 // This is a nicely-detailed HO-scale model of a Saxon Sate Railways (Epoch 1) 1st/2nd class express bogie coach - type ABBu - in the standard epoch 1 dark green livery, with a light grey roof. This is a very modern style of wooden-framed steel panelled side-corridor coach, with a steel chassis, and end-vestibule entrances and `concertina' connections for accessing other carriages. Some internal detail can be seen through the windows, such as the partitions and seating, and there are opaque-window lavatory compartments. The running number is 103.This model is fitted with the standard `loop' style of coupling. It is packaged in the current standard Piko card box with a transparent window, and a transparent plastic side-opening tray inside.This is a nicely detailed model of a high standard of manufacture, with a small packet of delicate bits for you to add. There are other models available to form a rake of these coaches.Note that I paid £37 for my model when new, so it is worth shopping around in your local model shops - or even a distant one. I live in London, but find it worth hopping on a train to Faversham in Kent to the Hobby Shop there for my models.","{""seller""=>{""Seller_name_1""=>""Gaugemaster"", ""Seller_price_1""=>""£34.95""}}"

 on 30 Dec. 2013 // I have recently decided to rebuild my model railway after many years being stored in a box.  I needed a controller and decided that a Gaugemaster was a good choice.  As I will be building the model railway in stages I wanted something to get me started and the single track contoller was ideal.  It didn't take me long to get it conected which is simple. I found it to be very smooth and I could maintain any speed, even very slow speeds without a problem and it would just run at that speed for as long as needed.  I will in due course buy a Gaugemaster multi track controller but this is ideal for what I need at this time.  I have been using this controller for several weeks now and I am still very pleased with it. | This is not a toy! // 4.0 // 3 Feb. 2013 // By

 on 21 May 2015 // Easy to install, either by slotting directly into OO gauge track or by joining wires to holes in the base plate of the signal. Easy to set-up, just assign 2x 2 digit accessory addresses from your DCC controller ( Each signal head is commanded independently ) and its ready to use. Full instructions included along with a ladder & sign plate to add even more realism if you so wish.  I have the Hornby E-link & Railmaster system and these work perfectly with it. Other types of signal are also available with single heads, distant & Home types. The real benefit of these signals is that because they are wire-free you can move them on your lay-out quickly if you change your mind or layout, so worth the extra cost compared with regular signals. plus they are LED for a long life. | Easy bit with placement limitations // 3.0 // 12 Oct. 2015 // By

 on 8 Oct. 2015 // Good little train set, something different to the normal with having a crane.The crane is the normal Hornby Breakdown crane, which you can get in a 'steam era' rusty colour or modern painted yellow.  This one is red with a British Rail symbol on the side (like from the 1980s). Of course, that doesn't match with steam train (a few decades out!); but this being a beginners train set that won't matter most young children (just be careful if your recipient is very clued up on these things!). The crane is weighted so it won't tip over when used to lift derailled trucks and wagons.  Add on winders are plugged in to operate the hook and crane height. Excellent pulley mechanism for raising the crane arm.The train has a plain colour scheme, like a general shunting train, as if it were one of many of the same kind. Almost gave it 4 stars because of this, but it's low priced so it stays at 5.The controller, track, wagon are all the usual good Hornby quality.Excellent small starter trainset, especially if you want to do more than just watch a train go round and round..... | Great set // 5.0 // 16 April 2015 // By

 on 8 Jan. 2016 // Nice starter set - has the standard basic oval and Track Pack one track, and a midi mat. The mat is paper, so not really durable for using over and over again unless you build a baseboard.The locomotive is a little under powered for the wagons - you need to be quite gentle setting off to prevent slipping, and the crane is quite hard to position on the rails, so maybe not the best for younger children who might get frustrated with.The detail on the engine is quite basic - if you like realism a bit of weathering may be good to make it look a bit better. The crane is lovely and nicely detailed. | Five Stars // 5.0 // 9 Dec. 2015 // By

This is useful as it's easy to shorten or lengthen the chassis to suit. I am using it under a 009 diesel kit and have had to shorten it by about 3mm to suit. This was quite easy and much easier than most 8 wheel drive chassis. The chassis itself is an excellent and smooth runner.

TOP 1000 REVIEWER on 18 Dec. 2014 // This is an excellent kit that has been around for more than fifty years . Detail is not what would be expected these days - the heavily applied boiler bands and handrails  detract from an otherwise accurate kit . These faults can , however , be rectified with care and despite this , the basic kit has been the basis over the years for countless , motorised , working  models . Not only can the kit be used to build a GWR 'City' class loco but determined 'kitbashers' can use it as the basis for several broadly similar GWR classes from the early years of the twentieth century .

As a static model, it needs careful work. It will reward extra effort. This isn't for the beginner. It has to lose a star because the manufacturing standards have improved.

 on 27 Feb. 2015 // Just built one of these! The body is self coloured in the right colour and the sides are lined out and lettered. The ends need to be painted black. Apart from the roof ventilators (which can be glued inside the roof) the whole kit clicks together ingeniously. It took about 10 mins to assemble this kit and the next will take more like 4 minutes. The only transfers/decals are the round LMS logos you can see in the centre.I don't agree with the assembly instructions! The body comprises sides ends and floor in a single piece. There is a rectangular cutout in the floor for the metal weight. I would fit the interior seat moulding into the body first. There is very little space between the compartment walls and the side of the coach to feed the flush-glaze window strips in. (They can't go in first) Particularly on the 2nd window strip I was concerned that I might overstretch the coach side at the end and make the plastic go milky. I was relieved when the glazing clicked into the windows. At that point, with the windows correctly in place, the corridor connections can be slid in the ends and the underframe offered up to the body (upside down with the metal weight located). The underframe latches actually click into the window strips to tie it all together. Likewise the roof clicks onto tabs on the window strips. Ingenious!Assembling and fitting the bogies was quite easy. The coupling retainers were fiddly though. Each coupling is plastic with a black metal hook. One of the hooks fell off. There is a C shape feature which clips onto a plastic bar and I needed to crunch it slightly with pliers, then adjust outwards with a screwdriver again until it clicked into place. The hook doesn't lift and drop as freely as it should now. It's on account of that and not being able to build the coach in the assembly instruction order (without feeling I was going to break something) that I've docked a star.","{""seller""=>[{""Seller_name_1""=>""Gaugemaster"", ""Seller_price_1""=>""£12.30""}, {""Seller_name_2""=>""Emmasaurus Shop"", ""Seller_price_2""=>""£17.25""}]}"

It is really well packaged, comes in its corgi box. Inside this box is a hardened case and the train is secured in it. The attention to detail is fantastic. It is in perfect condition and I am sure that this will make a lovely addition to anyone's collection. I really like the stories behind these trains and choosing of the name.

 on 8 Aug. 2014 // These ex-LNER Gresley teak-bodied buffet cars, built in the 1930's, survived long enough to receive all three British Railways coach liveries, crimson and cream, maroon (in which this model is also currently available) and finally the blue and grey depicted here used from the mid-1960's.  I've given this one 5* as opposed to the maroon one's 4* as in my opinion it looks much better in this blue and grey livery.  The reviews are virtually the same apart from that rating.  Presumably they lasted so long as a new buffet car cost much more than a new ordinary coach to build. It's stated on the Net that the last one was withdrawn in 1977 from Western Region use as W9135E, whilst the one depicted here, E9131E, lasted only until 1974.This model is up to the usual standard of recent Hornby coaches and, whilst a scale person wouldn't fit into the gap between the seats and tables, you must peer in through the windows to appreciate the best interior detail. It's a lovely little bar/counter complete with chrome edging, an (empty) transparent sandwich display case, what looks like a chrome coffee-maker and one of those metal foot-rests running the length of the bar/counter complete with the little pegs that hold it above floor level. No stools though, presumably to encourage folks to buy the curly sandwiches, over-priced drinks and then bog off back to their seats leaving it clear for more punters to part with their hard-earned.There's also a representation of the hand-rails at the windows by the buffet bar/counter to hold onto going over the points at junctions (or after a few expensive tinnies (which is all they used to have (and still do as far as I'm aware) in the beers department.Read more › | Five Stars // 5.0 // 5 Mar. 2015 // By

 on 24 Aug. 2010 // The interactive Chuggington is a brilliant idea. However I was left a little dissapointed. I was under the impression each chugger interacted with each other automatically. This is not so, you have to continually press the horn of each chugger and then they will interact and comment on what is around them i.e tunnell, chugwash etc....This is ok for older children who have grasped the idea and know what to do. But for younger children it reverts to a push along train and in effect is no different from the die-cast edition. I know as my child gets older he will develop his play but I feel a little mis-led by the concept. I have also had to return the action chugger as the paint on the wings was peeling. I have asked for a replacement however as action chugger is the main man in our household! Enjoy! | Wheels to the rails! // 4.0 // 22 April 2011 // By

 on 22 April 2011 // My 3 year old son loves his talking trains - they are in his top 3 toys. We initially bought him Koko and Wilson for Christmas but could not find a Brewster to go with them, so promised him one for his birthday, then we got him the Brewster with track and tunnel set. I have to say he gets more pleasure from the trains than the tracks, which are rather fiddly to set up (grown-ups have to do this) and he doesn't seem to have grasped that you have to raise the drawbridge with the little lever - if you raise it by hand, it tends to lift off the tracks so I'm constantly having to help him put it back. He also keeps switching the tunnel off for some reason. However, the toys are very sturdy, the trains in particular have been subjected to a certain amount of bashing but have withstood all ill treatment (I do take them away if he gets too boisterous).The trains are beautifully made - bright, sturdy, cheerful and just like their TV counterparts, with nice clear voices which are also individually distinctive. They prompt imaginative, interactive play - he talks to them and makes up stories for them, and we have to stop him taking them to bed with him otherwise he would stay up all night chatting! There seems to be quite a wide range of comments between the trains, although disappointingly, only a couple of responses to the tunnel and drawbridge. The trains respond over quite a large distance, for example he has left one on the stairs and you could hear it joining in while he played with the others in the living room, so I would say at least within hearing range. Of course now he wants the Chugwash (he saw it on the side of the box) so further sets & trains will have to be added in future...Read more › | My son loves this // 5.0 // 28 Dec. 2010 // By

 on 28 Dec. 2010 // I bought this for my 3 year old son for christmas and he hasn't stopped playing with it, for a last minute purchase it has turned out to be the best.  He loves it so much i've just bought the straigh& curved track and the extra level track to make it even more enjoyable... what i love most about this is that you can buy so many things to add on, so for easter i'll get him more for the track so he'll never get bored.I along with the othe person's review thought the trains would automatically interact with each other but my son is getting used to pressing the buttons more now so it's not so bad, i think for a younger child they wouldn't get as much fun from the interactive part.On the whole I would definately recommend this product... have fun chugging everyone xxx | What an excellent toy // 5.0 // 23 April 2014 // By

 on 23 April 2014 // I bought this (with an extra Wilson loco) for my very bright two year old grandson over 18 months ago.  It has easily been his all-time favourite toy and he always wants to play with it when he visits.  The larger size of the locos are just the right size for him to play with by himself and and the interactive noises keep him interested for ages.  The track must have been set out and taken up over 100 hundred times now, but everything still works perfectly with absolutely no broken parts (which I find amazing). | This a really good point and we're just got what we wanted // 5.0 // 6 Nov. 2014 // By

 on 24 Oct. 2010 // It's ok, just a train to push around, doesn't go on it's own. Only has a couple of phrases on it's own. I only have 2 interactive trains, they say a few things to each other but not a lot. You would need everthing for it to say as much as it can! To be honest, my son would have been happy if it didn't say anything at all. He played with them when I first got them and now they don't get out of the toy box much, but that's just kids! | Very clever little toys // 5.0 // 14 Dec. 2010 // By

 on 14 Dec. 2010 // Ordered a pair of these toys for use with the Interactive train set which I got my son for Christmas.First impressions are that the toys had me and the wife chuckling away in astonishment at how smart they are, they will actually recognise who they are talking to by name and interact with a couple of sentences. Most times it seems to be a different phrase but I can imagine the kids having loads of fun as I believe they will interact with the track itsself as well.Got them on special offer with Amazon, would work out fairly expensive paying full price for them all but for a fiver each, SUPER!!! | Foreign koko // 1.0 // 3 Jan. 2012 // By

 on 6 Sept. 2012 // We bought this for our little boy, Koko is the only train who's name he can say, and as soon as he opened it we got a big smile :)Koko says lots of different phrases to the other trains, and appropriate things at the different stops - chugg wash, rock quarry etc. She also uses electricity from the refuelling depo so she is different to the other trains we have that all take diesel.It is also nice to have a girl on the team, as most of the other trains are male (wilson, brewster, mtambo, chatsworth, dunbar etc).Overall; well worth the £5.55 we paid for it!

 on 27 Dec. 2013 // Have to be honest i genuinly expected the engines to move themselves. Judging by the fact the engines are twice the size of the standard ones, and why put a non slip type surface on the slopes when their to be pushed by hand ? I bought 3 different sets to build a larger layout, and not a hand in site on any of the pictures !Quality of the track and engines and extras very good, but the technology to make them move is not new , and would have been so simple and easy to install as they need batteries anyway. | let's interact.... but only if you push the button!! // 4.0 // 24 Aug. 2010 // By
